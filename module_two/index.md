title: Module 2 Career Development
---

## Overview
In accordance with our mission, our objective is for all Turing students to have the skills and abilities to pursue full-time employment in high fulfillment technical careers upon graduation. To do this, our curriculum focuses on five specific competencies:

* Networking: Using outreach and networking strategies to make connections in the software industry to support a student’s job search
* Interviewing: The skills needed to thoroughly respond to behavioral interview questions, articulate technical process, and demonstrate technical knowledge through code challenges
* Materials: A student’s branding materials that showcase their work for employers, i.e., LinkedIn, resume, portfolio, cover letter
* Job Search Strategies: A student’s understanding of their own goals and creating a set of steps to achieve them
* Negotiations: Understanding software industry market rates for compensation and the resources needed to negotiate for competitive rates

All of these will be addressed in Module 2 through a [scaffolded approach](https://www.edglossary.org/scaffolding/#:~:text=In%20education%2C%20scaffolding%20refers%20to,independence%20in%20the%20learning%20process.).

* SIAT make connections between skills/mindsets from previous career to new career
* SIAT provide relevant examples/utilize STAR in interview prep
* SIAT reflect on and describe their approach to problem-solving in independent/take-home challenges

**Materials Level II:**
* SIAT understand what makes them a unique asset to the tech industry in order to pull out aspects of identity to highlight in resume and portfolio
* SIAT summarize professional accomplishments and technical skills for a resume rough draft
* SIAT describe what makes a portfolio effective for a job search through analysis
* SIAT apply ideas of effective portfolios to rough draft
* SIAT describe what should and should not be included in a cover letter

**Job Search Strategies Level I:**
* SIAT identify work they enjoy doing at Turing and why
* SIAT describe values they are seeking from a workplace
* SIAT make connections between personal values based on their identity and values in an ideal workplace

**Negotiations Level I:**
* SIAT describe the benefits of negotiating job offers
* SIAT understand aspects of job offers (i.e., base salary, signing bonuses, benefits, equity, etc.)
* SIAT understand how the wage gap affects them based on their identity
* SIAT describes how their identity influences their feelings about negotiations

#### Deliverables to be completed by end of Module 2
* Resume draft reviewed by peers in week 5
* Students complete end of mod self-evaluation survey for CD team to assess support needs
* Portfolio review that includes self-evaluation

### What This Will Look Like Week-by-Week

* Sessions:
    * Week 1: [Introduction to Your Career Roadmap] -- Coming soon
    * Week 2: [Building Connection: Part I] -- Coming soon
    * Week 3: [Interview Prep] -- Coming soon
    * Week 4: [Career Roadmap: Part II] -- Coming soon
* Activities:
    * Week 4: What's a Dev?
    * Week 5: [Resume Draft Workshop] -- Coming soon

### Weekly Discussion Guidelines & Prompts
Every Wednesday afternoon, you'll meet with other students to discuss and collaborate on your professional development. Read through the overview on the [Homeroom Groups page](/student_discussion_groups/index) to understand what this will look like. Homeroom groups are with your cohort only and happen in Weeks 1-5 while Mix It Up groups are groups that are mixed across the entire student body and happen in Weeks 2 and 4.

* [Mix It Up Information](/mixed_groups)

### Repeating the Module
For students repeating Module 2, they are not required to attend workshops again unless they would like to. Instead, they will meet with the Career Development team, and using their self-evaluation from their first time through Mod 2, they will create specific goals to work on during the module. They will continue to meet with their Homeroom and Mix It Up groups on Wednesday afternoons.
