### Overview
This is your final PD activity during this module. By the end of the module, the goal is for you to achieve:

* LinkedIn updated and polished
* Working draft of your resume
* Terminal portfolio draft created and submitted for review
* Cover letter draft 
* Career Roadmap draft

### Working Group Guidelines
Your homeroom today is a time to work on the above deliverables and get feedback from each other. Here is how you can structure your time:

1. Revisit your norms as a group to understand how you'll approach feedback with each other in this space (5 mins)
2. Status check (5 mins)
   * Of the list above, what do you feel best about right now? What steps did you take to get that deliverable in good shape?
   * Of the list above, what 1 deliverable do you want to spend time working on today? What is your goal to have completed by the end of today's working session? 
3. Spend 30 minutes working on your chosen deliverable. 
4. Use the remaining 20 minutes for feedback. Each person gets a chance to share what they've been working on for about 5-7 minutes and each person should provide feedback that is **specific, actionable, and kind.**
