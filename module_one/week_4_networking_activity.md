title: Networking Activity - Week 4

## Mapping Your Network
You're midway through your first module at Turing. Let's take stock of the network you have and the new connections you've made. 

### Learning Goals for this Activity:

* Recognize your support systems and ensure that you have the right supports in place
* Document current and new connections as you build your networks
* Track your networking in once place

### How to Complete the Activity
Make a copy of [this tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-JY4qBv4Dxc7A1DLvkiJ8IDJJvGR_uMHKztXL16nk8/edit?usp=sharing)

1. On the first tab, take stock of your support network and how they support you. Use this information to understand what supports you have and what supports you might still need as you continue through Turing.

2. On the second tab, think about who you're already connected with from your background and previous experiences. These are people you have worked with previously, people you know through friends/family/co-workers, etc. They may or may not have a direct connection to the tech industry, but they may know someone who is in the tech industry or at a company you're interested in or they may have professional advice that will be helpful for you. You won't know until you map this out and understand the connections you do already have.

3. On the third tab, track the connections you have are making while at Turing. This is where you can log the information from your [Week 2 Networking Activity](/
