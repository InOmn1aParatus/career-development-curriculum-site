title: PD Plan for Repeating Module 1
---

Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search.

During your time in Mod 1 PD, we focused on building these core competencies:

* Build self-awareness around strengths and goals
* Build community through professional development
* Incorporate your mentor into job search support
* Establish sense of ownership over your professional development and job search

By the end of Module 1, we aim for students to achieve [Level I readiness](/standards_and_rubric/index) in Networking, Materials, and Interviewing. While you repeat the module, this is an opportunity to continue this work and think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.


## Expectations for Repeating the Module

### Sessions
You are **not** required to attend any of the professional development sessions you have attended previously. If you choose to attend any sessions, please plan to fully participate in activities, including breakout group discussions. Reminder of the weekly sessions:

* Week 1: [Understanding Your Developer Identity](/module_one/week_1_understanding_your_strengths)
* Week 3: [

### Homeroom Groups
You will be added to a new homeroom group with your new cohort. This is an opportunity to build new networking relationships. 



### What You'll Work On
For this module, you should create 2 [SMART goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals) you want to work on and track your progress towards those goals. What should these goals look like? 

1. Goal #1: Build a professional skill(s) that will contribute to your success at Turing.

Here are some examples:
  * Organization & time management
  * Communication
  * Project & priority management
  * Stress management
  * Take on a leadership role within your cohort through organizing study groups, leading a review session for the class, assisting SLC reps in facilitating cohort retros, organizing a non-coding social activity, etc.
  
2. Goal #2: Build a professional skill(s) that will contribute to your success at Turing.
  
  * Participate in an activity related to your new career outside of Turing (i.e., attend a meetup, network with an alum, research companies you're interested in, etc.)
  * Write a blog post about something you're learning





#### Goal (what is the goal): 

* Specific (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?): 

* Measurable (How can you measure progress and know if youâ€™ve successfully met your goal?):

* Achievable (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?):

* Relevant (How does this goal connect to your larger career goals?):

* Timebound (When do you plan to achieve this goal by? Be specific and consider how realistic your expectations are):
