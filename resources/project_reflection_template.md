Use this template to keep a log of reflections on each of your projects through Mod 1, 2, 3, and 4 at Turing. Feel free to add additional questions/prompts that you want to reflect on to help you prepare for future interviews.

## Abstract

* If you were to work with this same group again, what is one change the group could make to work together more effectively?
What was the greatest challenge you had as a group?

* How would you describe your role in this team? How often did you interact with other team members?

## Technical (Choose one)
* What was a specific technical challenge your group faced? How did you approach this challenge? What went well? What was a struggle?

* What resources or strategies did you use when you were presented with a technical challenge?

## Reflection

## Group Project Reflections
* What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects?

* How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
