title: Mod 2 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 2, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 2](#week-2)
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 4](#week-4)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
* What was helpful last mod?
* What do you want to keep doing?
* What do you want to stop doing?
* What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. Work on filling out the career roadmap to the best of your ability (make a copy) (15-20 mins)
3. Take turns sharing your takeaways from the career roadmap (15-20 mins)
4. As a group discuss: (10-15 mins)
* Based on what you filled out in the roadmap so far, what kinds of jobs will you be targeting?
* What should your resume include to show that these are the jobs you’re both qualified for and seeking?  
* What questions or concerns do you have about building your tech resume? Surface them with the group here and then bring them with you to the session tomorrow!

1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Your activity for the week is to [work on networking](/module_one/week_2_networking_activity). Discuss your progress on the activity (25 mins):

* Have you had your networking call for this week yet? 
* If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways? 
* If you haven’t had the call yet, when are you planning to set it up? Could you use support from this group to send the message to your contact?
* How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while you’re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?  

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Start off by discussing (10 mins)
   * How is your career story coming along?
