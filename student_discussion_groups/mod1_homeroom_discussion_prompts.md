### Guidelines
Homeroom groups are the name of the small group of you and your cohortmates that will meet on Wednesday afternoons in Weeks 1, 3, and 5. The purpose is for you and your group to discuss prompts and collaborate on activities related to the PD topics that week. 

With your group, we recommend:

* Setting norms on how you want to use the time together
