title: Mod 1 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

With your group, we recommend setting norms for your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Set norms for how you want to work together (15 mins)
2. Choose from the following discussion questions on strengths that the group would like to discuss. Choose several or just a few and share your thoughts (20-30 mins):

* What would it take for you to build more awareness of your strengths?
* What would you like to focus on in your professional development at Turing?
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
* What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?
* Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?
* Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?

3. Write out action steps you can take to develop awareness of your strengths and any challenges (recommended: use your career journal that you started in Mod 0 to record your reflections). How could you be aware of the progress you are making? (10-15 min)

### Week 2 Prompts & Structure (30 mins)
1. Revisit norms (5 mins)
2. Your activity for the week is to [work on networking](/module_one/week_2_networking_activity). Discuss your progress on the activity (25 mins):

* Have you had your networking call for this week yet? 
* If so, what did you discuss with your contact and what were your main takeaways? 
* If you haven’t had the call yet, when are you planning to set it up? Could you use support from this group to send the message to your contact?
* How do you feel about networking in general? What do you think it will take for you to build your network while you’re at Turing? What kind of support do you need in this area? How can this group provide that support for each other?
