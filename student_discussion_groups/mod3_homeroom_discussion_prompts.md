title: Mod 3 Homeroom Groups Guidelines & Prompts
---

### Guidelines
You and a small group of your cohortmates make up your homeroom. You'll meet on Wednesdays to discuss and collaborate on your professional development.

To start off Mod 3, we recommend revisiting norms with your group. These could include:

* What communication and feedback looks like within your group
* How to hold each other accountable
* If and how you will communicate outside of Wednesday group time. We encourage groups to form Slack channels if they would like!

Skip down to:
* [Week 2](#week-2)
* [Week 3](#week-3)
* [Week 4](#week-4)
* [Week 5](#week-5)

### Week 1 Prompts & Structure (60 mins)
1. Revisit norms for how your group wants to work together (15 mins):
  * What was helpful last mod?
  * What do you want to keep doing?
  * What do you want to stop doing?
  * What new ways do you want to collaborate with each other?

2. Work on filling out the career roadmap to the best of your ability (make a copy) (15-20 mins)
3. Take turns sharing your takeaways from the career roadmap (15-20 mins)
4. As a group discuss: (10-15 mins)
  * Based on what you filled out in the roadmap so far, what kinds of jobs will you be targeting?
  * What should your resume include to show that these are the jobs you’re both qualified for and seeking?  
  * What questions or concerns do you have about building your tech resume? Surface them with the group here and then bring them with you to the session tomorrow!

### Week 3 Prompts & Structure (60 mins) <a name="week-3"></a>
1. Revisit norms (5 mins) 
2. Your session this week is on interviewing, so let’s talk about interview prep and skills! Each person share (10 mins):
  * In previous interviews, what have you done well?
  * In previous interviews, what has been challenging for you?
  * What are your biggest concerns regarding interviews in the software industry? Write down some of these to discuss in tomorrow’s session

4. Discuss (15 mins):
  * What resource did you look at? What is helpful about it?
  * Technical interviews have a lot of similarities to assessments and evaluations you complete at Turing. Think back to your most recent assessment. What did you do well when it came to talking through your thought process? What do you want to improve on in this area? How could this group support you with that?
  * When you don’t know how to answer a technical question in an interview, what can you do?
  * What do you think are the 3 most important things an employer would want to know about a Turing graduate? How should you make sure to communicate that in an interview?

6. Close out the discussion (10 mins):
  * Share what you wrote about with your projects
