title: Measuring Professional Readiness
---

## Overview
The goal of the professional development curriculum is that on the day a student graduates, they are able to:
* Describe the kind of company and job they are seeking
* Articulate their professional story, making connections between their previous professional experiences and new career as well as describe their strengths, motivations, and passions
* Talk through their technical thought process, make connections between technical learning and tech used at company of choice, and solve technical challenges using process built at Turing
* Present high-quality materials for a job application (i.e., resume, cover letter, and updated portfolio)
* Tap into their current network and utilize strategies for building new relationships
* Use negotiation skills to lead to a satisfactory job offer

In order to reach that goal, we have broken down the professional development curriculum into 5 core competencies:

* Networking
* Interviewing
* Materials
* Job Search Strategies
* Negotiations

We recognize that everyone comes into Turing with their own unique identity and experience, including their professional experience. In order to both reach students where they are when they arrive at Turing, we have further broken down the core competencies into three levels (Level I, Level II, and Level III) so that students can engage with the curriculum at their own comfort level and also push themselves to grow professionally and be successful in their job search. The aim here is that even if a student hasn’t had any prior professional experience, they should be able to work through these standards to achieve Exceptional in Level III in all areas by the time they graduate.

### Networking

| Level I (Knowledge, Comprehension) | How it’s measured | Level II (Comprehension, Application) | How it’s measured | Level III (Application, Analysis, Synthesis) | How it’s measured |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Learning:<br><br>* Identification of what information needs to be acquired about the tech industry<br><br>Actions: <br><br>* Outreach in the Turing community | * SIAT describe their own needs in regards to their identity and networking<br><br>* SIAT formulate specific questions about the tech industry important to their experience and connect them to their career goals<br><br>* SIAT ask mentors questions about their jobs and career paths<br><br>* SIAT discuss career goals with mentor in at least two conversations | Learning:<br><br>* Make connections between information gathered and next steps for networking<br><br>Actions:<br><br>* Outreach to warm contacts<br><br>* Phone call/coffee meeting with warm contacts | * SIAT identify and utilize networking strategies that work best for them based on their own identity<br><br>* SIAT identify and utilize networking groups with which they identify <br><br>* SIAT identify contacts from their network to reach out to linked to specific reasons<br><br>* SIAT describe and demonstrate successful strategies for how to write messages to contacts<br><br>* SIAT schedule a coffee meeting/phone call<br><br>* SIAT formulate specific questions for coffee meeting tied to goals <br><br>* SIAT apply responses from contact to create connections to student’s own values and goals in their career path | Learning:<br><br>* Synthesize learning from initial outreach and apply to specific positions and/or further learning<br><br>Actions:<br><br>* Outreach for specific position<br><br>* Phone call/coffee meeting with cold contact<br><br>* Job shadow | * SIAT identify contacts outside their immediate network <br>from companies/industries that align with their interests<br><br>* SIAT identify relevant contacts from companies with positions <br>they want to pursue<br><br>* SIAT research company and contact to come up with relevant <br>questions for coffee meetings or job shadows<br><br>* SIAT analyze takeaways from conversations to apply to own <br>career goals and use in job application   |
