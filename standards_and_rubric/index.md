title: Measuring Professional Readiness
---

## Overview
The goal of the professional development curriculum is that on the day a student graduates, they are able to:
* Describe the kind of company and job they are seeking
* Articulate their professional story, making connections between their previous professional experiences and new career as well as describe their strengths, motivations, and passions
* Talk through their technical thought process, make connections between technical learning and tech used at company of choice, and solve technical challenges using process built at Turing
* Present high-quality materials for a job application (i.e., resume, cover letter, and updated portfolio)
* Tap into their current network and utilize strategies for building new relationships
* Use negotiation skills to lead to a satisfactory job offer

In order to reach that goal, we have broken down the professional development curriculum into 5 core competencies:

* Networking
* Interviewing
* Materials
* Job Search Strategies
* Negotiations

We recognize that everyone comes into Turing with their own unique identity and experience, including their professional experience. In order to both reach students where they are when they arrive at Turing, we have further broken down the core competencies into three levels (Level I, Level II, and Level III) so that students can engage with the curriculum at their own comfort level and also push themselves to grow professionally and be successful in their job search. The aim here is that even if a student hasn’t had any prior professional experience, they should be able to work through these standards to achieve Exceptional in Level III in all areas by the time they graduate.
