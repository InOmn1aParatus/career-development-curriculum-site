## Overview
The goal of the professional development curriculum is that on the day a student graduates, they are able to:
* Describe the kind of company and job they are seeking
* Articulate their professional story, making connections between their previous professional experiences and new career as well as describe their strengths, motivations, and passions
* Talk through their technical thought process, make connections between technical learning and tech used at company of choice, and solve technical challenges using process built at Turing
* Present high-quality materials for a job application (i.e., resume, cover letter, and updated portfolio)
* Tap into their current network and utilize strategies for building new relationships
* Use negotiation skills to lead to a satisfactory job offer

Even if a student hasnâ€™t had any prior professional experience, they should be able to work through these standards to achieve Exceptional in Level III in all areas by the time they graduate.
